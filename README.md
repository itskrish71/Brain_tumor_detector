# Brain_tumor_detector
## Intentions:
### Purpose of this model is to live detect Brain Tumor which affects approx. 90,000 people in US alone. With help of Brain_Tumor_detector, anyone can access the techonology to detect the tumor, further determining which type of tumor is in affect helping professionals predicting the tumor with highest accuracy.
## Procedure: 
### Data Handling and Preparation
#### 1. Loading the required datasets is essential. Making a seperate cell for the dedicated purpose would be convinient. 
#### 2. Next step would be loading the required datasets. This task have been achieved with the help of kagle datasets. Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset.
#### 3. Save all images path to two subdirectories 'yes' or 'no'. Before visualisation process make sure to label these 'yes' and 'no' folder to '1' and '0'. 
#### 4. Using matplotlib and cv2, you can check and visualise the dataset organised in the previous step.
#### 5. Dataset spliting
#### 6.
